<button type="button" class="collapsible">Choosing Seed Potatoes</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>What are they? Seed potatoes are small tubers (not actual seeds) that are used to grow new potato plants. They should be certified disease-free.
    Fun Fact: Each eye on a potato is a potential new plant! 
    Pre-Sprouting (Chitting)

Place seed potatoes in egg cartons or trays, eyes up, in a cool, bright place (like a windowsill) for 2-4 weeks.

This helps them develop strong sprouts before planting — leading to earlier and stronger growth.

</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Planting Potatoes</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Best Time to Plant: 2-4 weeks before the last expected frost.

Soil Requirements:

Loose, well-draining soil (sandy loam is ideal)

pH between 5.0–6.5

Enriched with compost but low in nitrogen (to avoid too much foliage growth)


Spacing:

Space rows 2.5–3 feet apart.

Place seed potatoes 12 inches apart, 4 inches deep, with sprouts facing up.


Hilling Method: Cover lightly at first. As they grow, keep mounding soil around stems to prevent sunlight from reaching the tubers (which causes greening and solanine – toxic!).
</p>
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Watering & Fertilization</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Watering:

Potatoes need 1–1.5 inches of water per week.

Critical times: when tubers are forming (usually 4-6 weeks after planting).

Avoid overhead watering — use drip irrigation to prevent leaf diseases.


Fertilization:

Use a balanced fertilizer (5-10-10 NPK).

Too much nitrogen = leafy plants and small tubers.

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Pests and Diseases</button>
<div class="content">
  <p> Common Pests:

Colorado Potato Beetle: Hand-pick and destroy eggs/larvae. Use neem oil or insecticidal soap.

Wireworms & Cutworms: Avoid planting where sod has recently been turned.

Aphids: Transmit viruses. Encourage ladybugs or spray with soapy water.


 Common Diseases:

Late Blight (Phytophthora infestans):

Same one that caused the Irish Potato Famine!

Appears as dark, oily spots on leaves and stems.

Prevent with copper-based fungicides and resistant varieties.


Scab (Streptomyces):

Caused by alkaline soil. Keep pH below 6.0.


Blackleg / Soft rot: Avoid overly wet soils and handle tubers gently.

</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Harvesting</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>
Early Harvest: 10–12 weeks after planting for new potatoes (small and tender).

Main Harvest: When foliage turns yellow and dies back (~15–20 weeks).

Cure the Potatoes:

Let them sit in a dark, well-ventilated area at 50–60°F for 10–14 days.

This toughens skin and improves storage life.
</p>
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Storage</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Ideal Conditions:

Cool (40–50°F), dark, and humid (85–90% humidity).

Never store in the fridge (starch converts to sugar).


Check Regularly: Remove any sprouting or soft potatoes to avoid spreading spoilage.

Extra Tips & Curiosities

Potato Towers & Grow Bags: Great for small spaces! Keep adding soil as the plants grow.

Companion Plants: Potatoes grow well with beans, corn, and cabbage. Avoid tomatoes and sunflowers (can share diseases).

Rotation: Don’t plant potatoes in the same spot for at least 2–3 years. Rotate with legumes or leafy greens.
