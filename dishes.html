     <h2>Air Fryer Crispy Potatoes </h2>
     <p>We pride ourselves for how perfect our roasted potatoes are. The only thing we've found to upgrade them? Using the air fryer. With just a little bit of oil, these potatoes get perfectly crispy on the outside while staying perfectly soft on the inside. One of our fave air fryer recipes to date, and that's saying a lot </p>

     <h2>Potato Tacos</h2>
     <p>These tacos, packed with crispy, spicy potatoes, are a carbolicious dream.
