    <h3 class="tits">Birthplace of the Spud: The Andes Mountains (8000–5000 BCE)
</h3>
    <p class="parafs">Long before French fries or mashed potatoes made it to our plates, potatoes were growing wild in the rugged Andes Mountains of modern-day Peru and northwest Bolivia. Around 7,000–10,000 years ago, the indigenous peoples began domesticating them. These early potatoes were bitter and came in a rainbow of colors and shapes—some even had to be detoxified with clay!

Cool fact: Ancient Peruvians developed chuno, a freeze-dried potato that could last for years. They’d leave them out to freeze at night and stomp out the moisture during the day.

    <h3 class="tits">Sacred Spud: A Staple in Incan Civilization
</h3>
    <p class="parafs">
To the Incas, potatoes weren’t just food—they were sacred. They used them to tell time (measuring time in how long it took to cook a potato), treat injuries, and predict weather. Potatoes were so central to life that they even had their own goddess: Axomamma, the potato deity.

    <h3 class="tits">Crossing the Atlantic: The Spanish Conquest (1500s)
</h3>
    <p class="parafs">When the Spanish conquistadors arrived in the 16th century, they brought back all kinds of treasures—gold, silver... and potatoes. At first, Europeans were suspicious of this odd root vegetable. Some even believed it caused leprosy or was fit only for animals and prisoners.

But potatoes had a secret weapon: They grew almost anywhere, needed little care, and packed a powerful nutritional punch—especially Vitamin C and calories.

    <h3 class="tits">Europe’s Secret Weapon (1700s–1800s)
</h3>
    <p class="parafs">Gradually, potatoes became a staple in Europe. In France, the military pharmacist Antoine-Augustin Parmentier promoted them tirelessly—even hosting potato dinners for the likes of Benjamin Franklin and King Louis XVI.

In Ireland, the potato revolutionized agriculture. It allowed families to survive on tiny plots of land, feeding both people and livestock. But this dependence would come at a terrible cost...

    <h3 class="tits">Tragedy Strikes: The Irish Potato Famine (1845–1852)
</h3>
    <p class="parafs">In the mid-1800s, a fungal disease called Phytophthora infestans (potato blight) wiped out much of Ireland’s potato crop, which was almost entirely made up of one vulnerable variety. Over a million people died, and another million emigrated—many to the United States.

Lesson: Monoculture (growing only one variety) can be catastrophic.
</p>

    <h3 class="tits">The Global Potato Boom (1900s–Today)
</h3>
    <p class="parafs">By the 20th century, potatoes had gone global. From vodka in Russia to samosas in India, gnocchi in Italy, and chips in England, potatoes became one of the most versatile and beloved foods on Earth.

The United Nations even declared 2008 the International Year of the Potato, recognizing its importance in fighting world hunger.
